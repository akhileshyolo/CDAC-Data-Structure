Binary Tree Operations
======================

structure of binary tree
------------------------

	struct BTNode {

           // Data Element
	   int data;

	   struct BTNode *left;
	   struct BTNode *right;

	}

Operations
----------

	inserting a node
	deleting a node
	traversing the tree
	searching for specific element

Finding size, height, etc.

Usage
-----
	Expression trees
	Data compression (Huffman coding trees)
	Binary Search Tree supports search, insertion, deletion on a collection of items with Order(log n) (average time complexity)
